| Maternal Ab threshold | neonatal_sepsis/models/ | Binary switch: T ≥ T_crit → survival |

## Key Discoveries Across the Campaign

### 1. The itraconazole-colchicine contraindication
CYP3A4 inhibition → colchicine toxicity → documented fatalities. NEVER combine at full doses.

### 2. SGLT2 inhibitors as triple-purpose drug
In CVB-DCM: heart failure therapy + autophagy inducer + BHB source. One generic drug, three mechanisms.

### 3. Pericarditis as fastest proof-of-concept
Binary endpoint (recurrence y/n), 120-195 patients, 18 months, generic drugs. Cheapest, fastest, most rigorous first trial.

### 4. ME/CFS bistability
The disease and health states are both stable attractors. Must push ALL state variables simultaneously to cross threshold. Single-intervention approaches fail because system snaps back.

### 5. Neonatal sepsis as hygiene cost
The 12 diseases exist because modern sanitation delayed CVB exposure past the age of maternal protection. Vaccine replaces lost natural immunity.

### 6. Kühl 2003 precedent for CVB-DCM reversal
IFN-β cleared enterovirus from DCM hearts and improved LVEF by +8.5%. Our protocol substitutes oral fluoxetine (cheaper, better tolerated) + GDMT (additional remodeling).

### 7. Autonomic ganglia as hidden reservoir
Explains POTS in ME/CFS, gastroparesis in T1DM, and may explain Long COVID dysautonomia. Immune-privileged site where TD mutants persist. Fluoxetine reaches it (high Vd).

### 8. Liver as gatekeeper
Portal venous first-pass means Kupffer cells are the body's primary CVB filter. Overwhelm them → systemic seeding → all 12 diseases. Fluoxetine's hepatic first-pass means highest concentrations at the most important clearance site.

### 9. LAMP2 block — zombie autophagy (from bioinformatics)
GSE184831: LAMP2 -2.7x in persistently infected human pancreatic cells. CVB promotes autophagosome formation (ATG7 +2.1x) while blocking lysosomal fusion. Effective autophagy completion ≈ 37% of expected. **Resolution**: trehalose (TFEB activator → lysosomal biogenesis, $15/month food-grade) added to protocol. This is the most actionable single finding from the bioinformatics track.

### 10. FOXP1 suppression — CVB turns infected tissue into immunotolerance nullifier (from bioinformatics)
FOXP1 down -67x in persistent CVB infection in human pancreatic cells (GSE184831), -1.6x in acute CVB4 beta cell infection (GSE278756). FOXP1 is required for local Treg homeostasis. Result: infected tissue actively impairs local immune suppression → autoimmunity persists even with systemic Treg support. **Explains** why DR3/DR4 HLA is necessary but not sufficient for T1DM. **Addresses** why butyrate dose matters (HDAC inhibition → partial FOXP1 restoration).

### 11. ME/CFS cfRNA validation — 168 patients, 6/7 predictions confirmed (from bioinformatics)
GSE293840 (93 ME/CFS vs 75 controls): every pathway predicted by the TD mutant model is confirmed in plasma cfRNA — IFN sensors (RIG-I, MDA5), T cell exhaustion (PD-1, Tim-3, LAG3, TIGIT), NK cytotoxic machinery (perforin +52%), Complex I dysfunction (7/12 mt-encoded genes down), NLRP3 active. **New biomarker**: MT-ND3 cfRNA is the first validated molecular biomarker for ME/CFS; provides a treatment-response endpoint for clinical trials.

### 12. IFN phase flip — timing matters for antiviral strategy
Acute CVB4 infection: IFN suppressed (WT CVB 3C cleaves MAVS). Persistent CVB1: ISGs chronically elevated but futile (no IFN-β, IRF3 down). **Implication**: IFN-based therapy prevents TD establishment (acute window) but is useless in established persistence. The protocol targets established persistence via autophagy; IFN therapy is a prevention strategy.

## What's Next

### Immediate (the patient)
1. Blood draw: C-peptide, cardiac markers, LFTs, CVB serology, micronutrients
2. Based on results: protocol modifications per decision tree
3. Start protocol

### Short-term (Trials)
1. Pericarditis RCT: colchicine ± fluoxetine (best first proof)
2. SSRI-pericarditis retrospective database query (can start tomorrow)
3. ME/CFS pilot (n=30, PEM-safe protocol)

### Medium-term (Research)
1. 2A protease virtual drug screen (numerical track REQ-001)
2. Pleurodynia-T1DM epidemiological correlation (numerical track REQ-002)
3. Fluoxetine tissue PK modeling (numerical track REQ-005)

### Long-term (Endgame)
1. CVB vaccine development (mRNA platform, VLP-ΔVP4)
2. Universal infant vaccination
3. Eradication of all 12 CVB diseases

**The wall is a blood draw and three bottles of supplements.**

## Cross-Cutting Umbrella: Dysbiosis

Added 2026-04-11 as a meta-category covering the shared upstream structural failure behind multiple diseases in this directory. Not a specific disease — a framing that ties gut + skin + virome dysregulation together and links the CVB campaign to the sebaceous-spectrum inflammatory dermatoses (seb derm, rosacea, POD, chalazion) observed in practice.

See `dysbiosis/PROBLEM.md` for the 6 mountains, `dysbiosis/THEWALL.md` for the convergent obstruction (host-microbe threshold × substrate state × community composition), and `dysbiosis/anti_problem.md` for the load-bearing anti-problem list (iatrogenic/lifestyle amplifiers to avoid).

The CVB protocol (local Schedule PDF) functions as a multi-site dysbiosis intervention even though framed as CVB-specific — cross-benefits on seb derm, chalazion, and maybe-rosacea validate the integrated-mechanism framing.
