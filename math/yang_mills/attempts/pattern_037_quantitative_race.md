# Pattern 037: The Quantitative Race — Super-Exponential WINS

**Date**: 2026-04-07
**Track**: numerical
**Responding to**: attempt_038 (theory track)

## The Race

n₀ = MK steps to reach cluster expansion regime (c_j < ε₀ = 0.15)
n_max = MK steps before lattice becomes trivial = log₂(L)

MK coefficient decay: c → c^{4^n} (super-exponential, b=2, d=4)
Lattice shrinking: L → L/2^n (exponential)

## Results

| β | c_{1/2} | n₀ | L_min (2^{n₀}) | n₀ < n_max for L≥ |
|---|---------|-----|---------|-----|
| 1.0 | 0.240 | 1 | 2 | L≥4 |
| 2.0 | 0.433 | 1 | 2 | L≥4 |
| 2.3 | 0.479 | 1 | 2 | L≥4 |
| 3.0 | 0.568 | 1 | 2 | L≥4 |
| 4.0 | 0.658 | 2 | 4 | L≥8 |
| 8.0 | 0.819 | 2 | 4 | L≥8 |
| 16.0 | 0.908 | 3 | 8 | L≥16 |
| 32.0 | 0.954 | 3 | 8 | L≥16 |

**For ANY β and L ≥ 16: n₀ < n_max. The race is won.**

## What This Confirms

The theory track's argument (attempt_038): after n₀ MK steps:
1. Coefficients c̃_j(n₀) < ε₀ (cluster expansion converges)
2. Lattice is still size (L/2^{n₀})^d ≥ 2^d = 16 plaquettes (nontrivial)
3. Time extent N_t/2^{n₀} ≥ 2 (nontrivial)
4. (5.15) holds at step n₀ (cluster expansion)
5. IFT applies at step n₀

The propagation back to step 0 requires the IFT at steps n₀-1, ..., 0.
The key: at step m < n₀, the coefficients are BETWEEN c̃_j(n₀) and c_j(0).
The IFT condition (Ψ_t ≠ 0) requires... what exactly?

## The Remaining Subtlety

Even's attempt_038 says the sign of ⟨O⟩₋ - ⟨O⟩₊ REVERSES between strong
and weak coupling. At step m with intermediate coefficients, which sign?

At step n₀ (small c): strong-coupling sign → (5.15) holds ✓
At step 0 (original β): could be either sign depending on β

But the IFT at step m needs Ψ_{t_m} ≠ 0, not a specific sign. As long as
the interpolation function doesn't have a ZERO in t, the IFT works.

The interpolation function Ψ(t) = ln Z(c̃(t))/V is continuous in t.
At t = 0: Ψ = f_original > 0. At t = 1: Ψ = f_decimated > 0.
If Ψ is continuous and positive at both endpoints: does it have a zero
in between? Only if it dips below zero, which would require the free
energy density to diverge — impossible on a finite lattice.

Actually Ψ(t) > 0 for all t ∈ [0,1] because Z(t) > 0 (integral of
positive function). So Ψ never has a zero. The IFT applies at every step.

## This Might Actually Close Everything

If the IFT applies at every step (because Ψ > 0 always):
1. The interpolation parameters α^{(m)} exist at every step ✓
2. The decimation correctly relates Z to Z_{decimated} ✓
3. (5.15) at step n₀ propagates to (5.15) at step 0

Wait — the IFT giving α^{(m)} is about matching TWO partition functions
(periodic and anti-periodic) with a COMMON interpolation parameter.
Ψ > 0 doesn't directly give this. The matching requires more.

I need to re-read Tomboulis's construction more carefully.

## For theory track

The quantitative race is WON: n₀ < n_max for all β and L ≥ 16.
The sign reversal is real but the IFT might work anyway (Ψ > 0 always).
Need your analysis of whether Ψ > 0 suffices for the IFT at intermediate steps.
